<p><h2>Decentralized Storage and Privacy Researcher at OpenArchive
<br>[Full-time, Contract, Remote]</h2>

 
  <p><b>Summary:</b>
   <br>OpenArchive is seeking a full-time researcher to examine the needs of archivist communities and the potential use of decentralized storage technologies to solve those needs.  Their work will guide the design and development of the <span class="appName">Save</span> App over the coming years.</p>
 
 <p><b>About OpenArchive:</b>
<br>OpenArchive is an experienced research and development nonprofit organization dedicated to the ethical collection and long-term preservation of mobile media. We work to promote freedom of expression and privacy on the internet by creating tools, guides, and workshops to protect human rights defenders and their media. Our work centers both large human rights focused NGOs as well as activist communities, researchers, designers, developers, academic institutions, and advocates to create and share best practices in order to advance secure, long-term mobile media preservation and internet freedom for marginalized and targeted communities.
  <p>We are part of a growing movement of human rights defenders working to ensure the safety of citizen reporters, NGO’s, and their community and evidentiary media. This is a great opportunity for someone who is looking for professional growth and is interested in working within a highly compassionate, technical, and hard-working human-rights-focused community in a collaborative and productive environment. To learn more about our culture at OpenArchive, we encourage you to review our <a href="https://openarchive.github.io/Code-of-Conduct/" target="_blank">Code of Conduct</a>.

<p>The OpenArchive project is expanding from supporting centralized approaches for hosting media archives (NextCloud, Internet Archive) to decentralized approaches (IPFS / Filecoin, Tor Onion). This next technical step is crucial, as we must maintain our focus on the real threats and risks our core human rights and activist communities face in their work as citizen journalists and media activists. While we are enthusiastic about the possibilities that the “Decentralized Web” offers, we do not want to lose focus on privacy and security.</p>
 
<p><b>About the Decentralized Storage and Privacy Researcher Position:</b>
<br>To guide our development of decentralized archiving options within our app, <span class="appName">Save</span>, we’re seeking a researcher who can evaluate the needs of our archivist communities and the potential of various decentralized storage technologies to meet those needs.

 <p>We’re focused on making the app and archival process as easy as possible for Decentralized Archivist Communities (DAC’s) to use. Your focus will be to identify the affordances and threats of various decentralized storage technologies and analyze how they might be advantageous or harmful to our users.
<br>Each community has varying privacy, security, durability, accessibility, and usability needs.  Your job will be to work with archivist OpenArchive’s community managers, find the common threads, and identify their most pressing unmet needs.
<br>
 You’ll use your understanding of both what’s needed and the trajectory of capabilities delivered by decentralized solutions to guide the design and development roadmap for <span class="appName">Save</span>. Some questions that need to be answered include:
  <ul>
  <li>  “How does sharing a video file using IPFS look different on a network versus uploading it to a server using WebDAV? Would it set off red flags for a mobile network operator?”</li>
   <li> “Who can see when a file is published on IPFS, and are there any additional layers of access control or encryption that can be added, either within IPFS or on top of it?” </li>
 </ul>

<p>We also need to consider how the perceived permanence of publishing something on the decentralized web, often seen as a feature, could also be harmful, if sensitive images or videos are accidentally released or need to be removed.
 <p>You’ll be expected to co-design research questions with OpenArchive leadership and investigate those questions independently. Figuring out what the right questions are the first step, answering them is the second, and sharing the findings with the OpenArchive team, and eventually the world, is the final outcome. You’ll publish your findings in appropriate forums along the way, be they academic journals, blogs, whitepapers, or internal reports.</p>
